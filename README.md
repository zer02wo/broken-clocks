# broken-clock

    A broken clock is right twice a day,
            720 broken clocks tell a different story.

## Description

This project is envisioned to be an artistic piece, working best on larger screens and in contemporary environments.

## Features

* Clock order toggling (Spacebar)
    * Chronological ordering:
        * Rows of clocks work as a *"meta-clock"*. Viewing the position of the *correct* timed clock as the indicator of a progress bar.
        * Reminscent of reading a binary clock.
    * Random ordering:
        * Rows of clocks act as an aesthetic piece or interactive game.
        * Random rotation of clock hands creates a unique pattern and emphasises the crazed and broken nature of the project.

* Thematic style toggling (Left Click)
    * Interpretations of the neumorphic design style in both *light* and *dark* themes

* Automatic page scrolling
    * Follows the position of the *correct* timed clock

* Accurate time keeping
    * Clocks update in real-time within *500ms*
